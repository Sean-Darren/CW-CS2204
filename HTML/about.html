          We emphasize a student-centered approach by encouraging undergraduate
          students to engage in research and development activities from their
          first year. Our innovative environment allows students to join
          research groups and projects, fostering collaboration and hands-on
          experience. To enhance their global perspectives, we offer various
          opportunities for overseas study and internships at prestigious

          hub features three distinct zones: the Technology Zone, Innovation
          Zone, and Ecology Zone, each designed to support specific areas of
          research and development. We have created a robust entrepreneurial
          ecosystem, resulting in the establishment of 370 spin-off companies,
